This is a Vagrant project to spin up an Ubuntu VM to allow testing of the Storage Manager app.

Its not complete in that you need to make your code accessible somewhere, and provide a database backup.
In addition the source code is not runnable without alteration, I had to make the following manual changes...

Created an htaccess file based on htaccess.dev
Created a database.php file based on database.php.default
Created a core.php file based on core.php.dev
Created an app/tmp directory with 777 perms
